                <p>Hi there- my name is Ashley Evans. Before becoming a full stack developer, I spent 10 years working in and managing Managed Services IT companies where I focused heavily on making sure the business was efficient and scalable. I bring the same mindset to coding as I want to be able to code with a team of other developers at the end of the UW Coding Bootcamp.</p>
